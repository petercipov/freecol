FreeCol is a turn-based strategy game based on the old game
Colonization, and similar to Civilization. The objective of the game is
to create an independent nation.

You start with only a few colonists defying the stormy seas in their
search for new land. Will you guide them on the Colonization of a New
World?

## About FreeCol

**Website: [FreeCol.org](http://www.freecol.org/)**

The FreeCol team aims to create an Open Source version of Colonization
(released under the GPL). At first we'll try to make an exact clone of
Colonization. The visuals will be brought up to date with more recent
standards but will remain clean, simple and functional. Certain new
'features' will be implemented but the gameplay and the rules will be
exactly the same as the original game. Examples of modern features are:
an isometric map and multiplayer support.


## Building

Build the latest version of the code by running:

```sh
mvn verify
mvn build
```

Requires Java 9, Mvn, and Java SDK to build.
